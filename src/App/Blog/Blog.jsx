  <p>Why are we so nostalgic for the 1990s?</p>
  <p>
    Pop culture used to define a generation, but it seems the cultural, music
    and fashion trends of the 1990s have been recycled, and what Generation X
    considered its rite of passage into adulthood, is being discovered and
    claimed by fledgling grown-ups as their own.

  <p>
    There's been the resurgence of vinyl as the trend-setters' choice of music
    consumption rather than the ease of a digital download, and now the hipsters
    have discovered the nostalgic sound of a whirring cassette from which to
    enjoy the dulcet tones of everyone from Salt-N-Pepa to Rick Astley.

  <h1>I make mistakes!</h1>

    “I’m selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of
    control and at times hard to handle. But if you can’t handle me at my
    worst,then you sure as hell don’t deserve me at my best.”

    The death of Queen Elizabeth II on September 8 at the age of 96 represents a
    monumental shift for the British monarchy and the people of England. Royals
    have died before, of course, but the Queen ruled for more than 70 years, and
    represented a certain stability and decorum that held the institution of the
    Royal Family together as it slowly grew more visibly anachronistic and
    battered by endless scandals.
