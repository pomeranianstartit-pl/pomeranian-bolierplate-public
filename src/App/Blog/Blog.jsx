          <p className="tresc1">
            Pop culture used to define a generation, but it seems the cultural,
            music and fashion trends of the 1990s have been recycled, and what
            Generation X considered its rite of passage into adulthood, is being
            discovered and claimed by fledgling grown-ups as their own.

          <p className="tresc2">
            There's been the resurgence of vinyl as the trend-setters' choice of
            music consumption rather than the ease of a digital download, and
            now the hipsters have discovered the nostalgic sound of a whirring
            cassette from which to enjoy the dulcet tones of everyone from
            Salt-N-Pepa to Rick Astley.

            The death of Queen Elizabeth II on September 8 at the age of 96
            represents a monumental shift for the British monarchy and the
            people of England. Royals have died before, of course, but the Queen
            ruled for more than 70 years, and represented a certain stability
            and decorum that held the institution of the Royal Family together
            as it slowly grew more visibly anachronistic and battered by endless
            scandals.
