        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Why are we so nostalgic for the 1990s?</h2>
        <p>
          Pop culture used to define a generation, but it seems the cultural,
          music and fashion trends of the 1990s have been recycled, and what
          Generation X considered its rite of passage into adulthood, is being
          discovered and claimed by fledgling grown-ups as their own.
          <br />
          <br />
          There's been the resurgence of vinyl as the trend-setters' choice of
          music consumption rather than the ease of a digital download, and now
          the hipsters have discovered the nostalgic sound of a whirring
          cassette from which to enjoy the dulcet tones of everyone from
          Salt-N-Pepa to Rick Astley.

          out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can’t handle me
          at my worst, then you sure as hell don’t deserve me at my best.”

        <p>
          The death of Queen Elizabeth II on September 8 at the age of 96
          represents a monumental shift for the British monarchy and the people
          of England. Royals have died before, of course, but the Queen ruled
          for more than 70 years, and represented a certain stability and
          decorum that held the institution of the Royal Family together as it
          slowly grew more visibly anachronistic and battered by endless
          scandals.
