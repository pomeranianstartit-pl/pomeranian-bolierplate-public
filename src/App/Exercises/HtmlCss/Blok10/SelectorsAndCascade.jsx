   <h1>Why are we so nostalgic for the 1990s?</h1> 
   <p> Pop culture used to define a generation, but it seems the cultural, music and fashion trends of the 1990s have been recycled, and what Generation X considered its rite of passage into adulthood, is being discovered and claimed by fledgling grown-ups as their own. There's been the resurgence of vinyl as the trend-setters' choice of music consumption rather than the ease of a digital download, and now the hipsters have discovered the nostalgic sound of a whirring cassette from which to enjoy the dulcet tones of everyone from Salt-N-Pepa to Rick Astley.

          <p> “I’m selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can’t handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don’t deserve me at my best.” </p>

            <h1>18 Record-Breaking, Controversial, and Weird Facts </h1> 
            <p> The death of Queen Elizabeth II on September 8 at the age of 96 represents a monumental shift for the British monarchy and the people of England. Royals have died before, of course, but the Queen ruled for more than 70 years, and represented a certain stability and decorum that held the institution of the Royal Family together as it slowly grew more visibly anachronistic and battered by endless scandals. </p>
